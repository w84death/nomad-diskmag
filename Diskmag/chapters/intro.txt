1. Introduction to the Diskmag
Krzysztof Krystian Jankowski
As a hacker, I like to challenge myself for learning new things. I also like to write about the stuff I do. Combining those two I came up with a diskmag - digital magazine. In the days of glory, those zines were distributed on tapes and discettes. To keep this project in the mood I also want to share the sources on the real floppy.

Where diskmag exceeds is in the interactivity and animations. I can add buttons, index, and customize each article down to the color of the cursor. Instead of images, I'm creating clipart-like graphics from primitives by code.
From a programming point of view, it's also a lot of domains to touch. The whole UI, scenes renderer, drawing pictures or word wrapping paragraphs. This application is also the first python code that I build as a one file binary for sharing.

I have many web pages and blogs where I could publish my articles. But none of those are cool enough to beat a real diskmag :)

Plot twist. I made this whole project on a Raspberry Pi 4. This Pi hooked to a 40" NEC was my benchmark. This way I was sure that anyone will be able to run and read the magazine.

Enjoy reading.
