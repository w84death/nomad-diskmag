3. Pyhton is fun
Krzysztof Krystian Jankowski
As a very young kid I discovered QBASIC. I learned programming using it. Since then I advocated it as the best first language. 
Over the years I learned also ARM Assembly, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP, Lua and, Python. All of them have strangths and wiknesses but one stands out. Python. Python3 in particular. For me it's all I want from language.

My perfect language shoudl have those features:
- easy to use
- clean code
- OOP
- easy to package/build
- cross platform code
- rich community

And python have all  of those. It's not perfect but nothing is. 

Where fun begins is on Raspberry Pi. Python is the main programming language in its ecosystem. It's already installed and configured. Every accesory, sensor or monitor have library for python. And almost all instructions provides python examples.

I always like to learn by doing some project. For sharping my skills with OOP in Python I created this aplication. I created classes for buttons, labels and so on. Orginized code in files. Lastly I discovered pyinstaller that pack everything in one executable file.
